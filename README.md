PDF-XAI is an open-source Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed for accurate and explainable query resolution from complex PDF documents, achieving 89.7% accuracy and a 38.7% improvement in semantic coherence over traditional RAG systems. It employs a modular architecture with multi-query expansion (3â€“5 sub-queries), Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF, k=60), and asymmetric context retrieval (1:2 chunk extension) to enhance retrieval relevance and response quality. Built using LangChain for graph-based workflow orchestration, PyMuPDF for intelligent PDF parsing, ChromaDB for real-time vector storage, and LLaMA-3.1-8B for response generation, PDF-XAI ensures transparency through dual logging (pipeline and chunk-level) and StateGraph tracking, making it ideal for sensitive domains like healthcare and law. The system includes GDPR-compliant data redaction and bias mitigation via neutral prompts, processing 142 queries/min with 4.1 GB memory and 89% storage reduction. This repository provides `main.py`, a CLI script for querying PDFs, and an MIT `LICENSE`. Limitations include 68.3% accuracy for temporal queries and 72.1% for image-heavy PDFs, with future enhancements planned for vision-language models and hybrid retrieval.
